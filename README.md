Being not terribly satisfied with the options on [frame.work](https://frame.work/)'s website, I decided to embark on this journey. After doing a [inital Bill Of Materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YayfsNAYgf5DBnbEC524bHOcLVi5MpsAGUarsPbGo8w/edit?usp=sharing) (MSRP and totals paid will live on the google doc) I truly decided I must be insane for doing this.

LSS, I estimate I'll be *over* paying for the *convenience* of building my own Framework by ~$168 based on MSRP alone. I am going to combine parts orders where I can to mitigate shipping.

Moving on.

# Assembly
- [ ] [Bottom Cover Replacement Guide](https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Bottom+Cover+Replacement+Guide/107?lang=en)
- [ ] [Top Cover Replacement Guide](https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Top+Cover+Replacement+Guide/118?lang=en)

I likely won't have my own commentary in this section until at least the Top Cover arrives due to lack of having anything to actually *assemble* to.

# Testing *TK*
1. Likely this section won't have the furst update until the Mainboard is ordered owning to not having anything to actually *test* with.

# Results & Final Thoughts *TK*
1. Naturally this will be last to be completed. *gasp*

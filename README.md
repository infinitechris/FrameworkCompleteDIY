Being not terribly satisfied with the options on [frame.work](https://frame.work/)'s website, I decided to embark on this journey. After doing a [inital Bill Of Materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YayfsNAYgf5DBnbEC524bHOcLVi5MpsAGUarsPbGo8w/edit?usp=sharing) (MSRP and totals paid will live on the google doc) I truly decided I must be insane for doing this.

LSS, I estimate I'll be *over* paying for the *convenience* of building my own Framework by ~$168 based on MSRP alone.

I am going to combine parts orders where I can to mitigate shipping.

Moving on.

## Additioal Nice-to-Haves
These won't be needed for the laptop to be functional, but I might eventually get most of them to lessen my dependency on dongles and my usb hub.
- [ ] [Webcam Module](https://frame.work/products/webcam-module?v=FRANCPPA01)
      - This will be nice to have for video confrencing at work, but likely I won't get it unless there's a gaping hole in the display that aesthetically bothers me 
- [ ] [IntelÂ® Wi-Fi 6E AX210](https://frame.work/products/intel-wi-fi-6e-ax210-no-vpro)
     - I have a [Raspberry Pi USB WiFi Dongle](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-usb-wifi-dongle/) that has the same chipset (BCM43143) that the Raspberry Pi 3 uses (and is very well supported by linux) that I will be using in a USB hub (as long as the hub is supported.)
     - Likely this will be added first to lessen my dependency on a usb-c extension cable and hub
     - NB: none of the Framework marketplace or product pages were useful in determining which dongle was best. All thanks is owed to the community forum!!
     - See [this link](https://community.frame.work/t/is-25the-ax210-better-than-the-ax211/31943) for AX210 vs AX211
     - Per [this link](https://community.frame.work/t/solved-using-the-ax210-with-linux-on-the-framework-laptop/1844) it looks like I'll have to make sure I'm on kernel 5.12.0 and no later. FWIW: I'll be using vanilla Arch on this machine
- [ ] Expansion Modules
     - [ ] [USB-C Expansion Card](https://frame.work/products/usb-c-expansion-card?v=FRACCKBZ01)
          - I don't mind having to use an [usb-c extension cable](https://www.newegg.com/p/181-005S-000A5) for plugging in my hub, but this will be nice to not have to carry around this cable to use the hub
     - [ ] [USB-A Expansion Card](https://frame.work/products/usb-a-expansion-card)
          - This will be to lessen my dependence on having to use my usb hub
     - [ ] [HDMI (1st Gen) Expansion Card](https://frame.work/products/hdmi-expansion-card)
          - ditto the above
     - [ ] [MicroSD Expansion Card](https://frame.work/products/microsd-expansion-card)
          - more of the same
     - [ ] [Ethernet Expansion Card](https://frame.work/products/ethernet-expansion-card)
          - This one is the most gaudy of all of them, considering it sticks out as far as it does, and I may opt for a usb-c to ethernet adapter or an all-in-one docking solution instead of it.
  
# Assembly
Most of these I'll be only following the re-assembly portions for fairly obvious reasons.

I plan on implementing my own guide for anyone that wishes to do the same in the future

Why anyone else would torture themselves to do this is beyond me. I am doing it only for the challange :)

- [ ] [Bottom Cover Replacement Guide](https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Bottom+Cover+Replacement+Guide/107?lang=en)
- [ ] [Top Cover Replacement Guide](https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Top+Cover+Replacement+Guide/118?lang=en)
- [ ] [Hinge Replacement Guide](https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Hinge+Replacement+Guide/104?lang=en)

I likely won't have my own commentary in this section until at least the Top Cover arrives due to lack of having anything to actually *assemble* to.

# Testing
     *TK*
- Likely this section won't have the first update until the Mainboard is ordered owning to not having anything to actually *test* with.

# Results & Final Thoughts *TK*
- Naturally this will be last to be completed. *gasp*

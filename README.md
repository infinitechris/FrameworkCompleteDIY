Being not terribly satisfied with the options on [frame.work](https://frame.work/)'s website, I decided to embark on this journey. After doing a [inital Bill Of Materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YayfsNAYgf5DBnbEC524bHOcLVi5MpsAGUarsPbGo8w/edit?usp=sharing) (MSRP and totals paid will live on the google doc) I truly decided I must be insane for doing this. LSS, I extimate I'll be *over* paying for the *convenience* of building my own Framework by ~$270

Moving on.

# Why?
I'm **clearly** criminal levels of insane, and configuration options are scarse unless I want to pre-order a laptop, or be chained to a limited selection of products. I also wanted to see *exactly* how little is needed to boot a *usable* - in my own view - laptop

I will be skipping out on:
1. speakers
     - lots of reviews trash on the fact that they fire downwards
3. web cam
4. audio card
5. audio jack
6. wifi
7. system drive

I happen to have usb dongles for adding an audio jack, micro sd or full sized (via a hub that I have and intend to document what does *and doesn't* work) and wifi (via a raspberry pi wifi usb adapter), so skipping these until further testing reveals if any of the above are needed.

# Assembly
1. Links to Framewrk's own guides here, adding my own where needed.
2. Pictures, naturally,
3. Likely I won't have the first update to this section until the Top Cover arrives due to lack of having anything to actually *assemble* to.

# Testing *TK*
1. Likely this section won't have the furst update until the Mainboard is ordered owning to not having anything to actually *test* with.

# Results & Final Thoughts *TK*
1. Naturally this will be last to be completed. *gasp*

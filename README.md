Being not terribly satisfied with the options on [frame.work](https://frame.work/)'s website, I decided to embark on this journey. After doing a [inital Bill Of Materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YayfsNAYgf5DBnbEC524bHOcLVi5MpsAGUarsPbGo8w/edit?usp=sharing) (MSRP and totals paid will live on the google doc) I truly decided I must be insane for doing this.

LSS, I estimate I'll be *over* paying for the *convenience* of building my own Framework by ~$168 based on MSRP alone. I am going to combine parts orders where I can to mitigate shipping.

Moving on.

# Parts

## Needed
These are in order price
- [x] [Fastener Kit - Bottom Cover and Mainboard](https://frame.work/products/fastener-kit-bottom-cover-and-mainboard)
     - Ordered 6/23/202 (Shipped from NJ)
     - Looks there will be six extra T5 screws. Looking at the bottom disassembly guide, Only need 13 screws are needed and the kit includes 19. Extras are because they're included as captive in the bottom cover (which I'll be ordering as a kit.) This isn't the worst in the world :)
     - Which are extras and their placement aren't in any guide in the site. This means I won't know until I get there if the Top Cover Fastener kit will even be needed.

## Additioal Nice-to-Haves
These won't be needed for the laptop to be functional, but I might eventually get to lessen my dependency on dongles and my usb hub.
- [ ] [Webcam Module](https://frame.work/products/webcam-module?v=FRANCPPA01)
      - This will be nice to have for video confrencing at work, but likely I won't get it unless there's a gaping hole in the display that aesthetically bothers me 
- [ ] [IntelÂ® Wi-Fi 6E AX210](https://frame.work/products/intel-wi-fi-6e-ax210-no-vpro)
     - I have a wifi USB-A dongle that has the same chipset that the Raspberry Pi 3 uses that I will be using in a USB hub (as long as the hub is supported. Likely this will be upgraded
     - See [this link](https://community.frame.work/t/is-25the-ax210-better-than-the-ax211/31943) for AX210 vs AX211
     - Per [this link](https://community.frame.work/t/solved-using-the-ax210-with-linux-on-the-framework-laptop/1844) it looks like I'll have to make sure I'm on kernel 5.12.0 and no later. FWIW: I'll be using vanilla Arch on this machine
- [ ] Expansion Modules
     - [ ] [USB-C Expansion Card](https://frame.work/products/usb-c-expansion-card?v=FRACCKBZ01)
          - I don't mind having to use an [usb-c extension cable](https://www.newegg.com/p/181-005S-000A5) for plugging in my hub, but this will be nice to not have to carry around this cable to use the hub
     - [ ] [USB-A Expansion Card](https://frame.work/products/usb-a-expansion-card)
          - This will be to lessen my dependence on having to use my usb hub
     - [ ] [HDMI (1st Gen) Expansion Card](https://frame.work/products/hdmi-expansion-card)
          - ditto the above
     - [ ] [MicroSD Expansion Card](https://frame.work/products/microsd-expansion-card)
          - more of the same
     - [ ] [Ethernet Expansion Card](https://frame.work/products/ethernet-expansion-card)
          - This one is the most gaudy of all of them, considering it sticks out as far as it does, and I may opt for a usb-c to ethernet adapter or an all-in-one docking solution instead of it.
  
# Assembly
- [ ] [Bottom Cover Replacement Guide](https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Bottom+Cover+Replacement+Guide/107?lang=en)
- [ ] [Top Cover Replacement Guide](https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Top+Cover+Replacement+Guide/118?lang=en)

I likely won't have my own commentary in this section until at least the Top Cover arrives due to lack of having anything to actually *assemble* to.

# Testing
     *TK*
- Likely this section won't have the first update until the Mainboard is ordered owning to not having anything to actually *test* with.

# Results & Final Thoughts *TK*
- Naturally this will be last to be completed. *gasp*

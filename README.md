# FrameworkCompleteDIY
I decided document ny masochistic adventures in building my own Framework Laptop completely from parts

**Summary**
Being not terribly satisfied with the options on [https://frame.work/](frame.work)'s website, I decided to embark on this journey. After doing an [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YayfsNAYgf5DBnbEC524bHOcLVi5MpsAGUarsPbGo8w/edit?usp=sharing](inital Bill Of Materials) I truly decided I must be insane for doing this.

Moving on.

# The Parts

## Parts Purchased So Far
1. Fastener Kit - Bottom Cover and Mainboard x1 - Ordered 6/23/202 (Shipped from NJ)
   1. MSRP: USD $5.00
   2. Final cost: USD $$15.03
   3. I'll add some pictures once the package arrives and I have more to share than screenshots of readily available images on the web.

## Remaining Parts
1. Things
2. Stuff
3. More Things
  
# Why?
I'm **clearly** criminal levels of insane, and configuration options are scarse unless I want to pre-order a laptop, or be chained to a limited selection of products. I also wanted to see *exactly* how little is needed to boot a *usable* - in my own view - laptop

I will be skipping out on:
1. speakers
  1. lots of reviews trash on the fact that they fire downwards
2. web cam
3. audio card
4. audio jack
5. wifi
6. system drive

I happen to have usb dongles for adding an audio jack, micro sd or full sized (via a hub that I have and intend to document what does *and doesn't* work) and wifi (via a raspberry pi wifi usb adapter), so skipping these until further testing reveals if any of the above are needed.
